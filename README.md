# AI-Generated Code Repository

Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot and I walked into a bar. This is our collective creative consciousness. Welcome to the shit show.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to store AI-generated code in a clear and maintainable way.

### üìÅ Main Folders

#### AI Model Folders
Each AI provider has its own folder with subdirectories for different model versions:

- **Google Gemini/** - Google's Gemini models
  - `1.5 Flash/` - Gemini 1.5 Flash model outputs
  - `1.5 Pro/` - Gemini 1.5 Pro model outputs
  - `2.5 Flash/` - Gemini 2.5 Flash model outputs
  - `2.5 Pro/` - Gemini 2.5 Pro model outputs

- **OpenAI ChatGPT/** - OpenAI's ChatGPT models
  - `GPT-3.5/` - GPT-3.5 model outputs
  - `GPT-4/` - GPT-4 model outputs
  - `GPT-4 Turbo/` - GPT-4 Turbo model outputs
  - `o1/` - o1 series model outputs

- **Microsoft Copilot/** - Microsoft's Copilot
  - `Standard/` - Standard Copilot outputs
  - `Pro/` - Copilot Pro outputs

#### Special Purpose Folders

- **Comparisons/** - For side-by-side comparisons when the same question is asked to multiple AI models
- **Code-Snippets/** - Reusable code snippets and utilities
- **Projects/** - Complete projects and applications

### üöÄ Usage

1. **Single AI Response**: Place code in the appropriate AI model folder (e.g., `Google Gemini/2.5 Pro/`)
2. **Comparing Multiple AIs**: Create a folder in `Comparisons/` with responses from each AI
3. **Reusable Snippets**: Store in `Code-Snippets/` organized by language or category
4. **Full Projects**: Place complete applications in `Projects/` with their own subdirectories

### üìù Documentation

Each main folder contains a README.md with specific guidance on how to organize content within that folder.

### üí° Tips

- Add descriptive names to your files and folders
- Consider dating folders when comparing responses (e.g., `Comparisons/web-scraper-2025-01-15/`)
- Document which AI model generated code in project READMEs
- Feel free to create additional subdirectories as needed for better organization
