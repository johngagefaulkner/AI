# TailwindCSS Design Page

I was playing around with the idea of taking some of the IT documentation that's unsorted and stored in random folders as text `*.txt` files, Word `*.docx` documents, PDFs `*.pdf`, etc., and feeding it into either Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGPT 5, or the latest Microsoft Copilot, with the intention of having the AI analyze the data/contents of the documents, and convert them into single-page HTML files (the company I work for has an internal requirement of being able to load docs while offline) that is easy to read, looks great, and most importantly, follows the same document structure each and every time.

...I ended up displaying the new Microsoft 365 app icons in about 5 different ways, instead.

> #### _I think it's important to note that I blame myself for this one._
