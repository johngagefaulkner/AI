# System Monitor Widget

I set out with the intentions of learning how to create "headless" WinUI 3 app windows (likely using `AppWindowPresenter` as far as I could tell) to try to mimic some of the more recent WinUI 3 / WindowsAppSDK projects I've seen starting to pop-up on GitHub. I settled on the idea of a CPU hardware utilization app which was perfect considering I'd also been looking for a reason to try out the latest "WinUI 3-friendly" version of LiveCharts2.

## Prompt

> I want to build an app using WinUI 3, C# 14.0, .NET 10, and the Windows App SDK that uses AppWindowPresenter to show a headless window containing the graphs/charts/gauges displaying the userâ€™s CPU, RAM, GPU, and Storage utilization. See the attached image for design reference and concept context.

# Result

Now, I haven't quite figured out yet why Gemini 2.5 Pro decided to go this way (take this route, use this methodology, whatever) but the response I received was a Console app that loads all the XAML for the UI from a string... and a comment that says, "Loading GPU usage is hard so we're just gonna simulate it instead." **LOL**. Take a look at the "Getting Started" instructions I was given below and then see the file named `00-SystemMonitorWidget.cs` in this folder for the full code response.

### HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN:
1. Make sure you have the `.NET Desktop Development` and `Universal Windows Platform development` workloads installed via the Visual Studio Installer.
2. Ensure you have the latest `Windows App SDK` installed.
3. Create a new `C# Console App` project in Visual Studio.
4. Replace the entire contents of `Program.cs` with this code.
5. Add the required NuGet packages to your project:
    - `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK`
    - `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm`
6. In your project file `(.csproj)`, ensure the following:
```xml
<OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>
<TargetFramework>net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0</TargetFramework> <!-- Or a later version -->
<TargetPlatformMinVersion>10.0.17763.0</TargetPlatformMinVersion>
<UseWinUI>true</UseWinUI>
<EnableMsixTooling>true</EnableMsixTooling>
```
7. Build and run the project!
