# Comparisons

This folder is for storing responses when the same question or prompt is asked to multiple AI models for comparison purposes.

## Purpose

Use this folder when you want to:
- Compare how different AI models (Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot) respond to the same prompt
- Evaluate the quality and differences in code generation across models
- Analyze varying approaches to solving the same problem

## Suggested Organization

Create a subfolder for each comparison with a descriptive name, such as:
- `sorting-algorithms-comparison/`
- `web-scraper-comparison-2025-01-15/`
- `react-component-comparison/`

Within each comparison folder, you can create separate files or subdirectories for each AI model's response:
```
example-comparison/
├── gemini-2.5-pro-response.md
├── chatgpt-gpt4-response.md
├── copilot-pro-response.md
└── analysis.md
```
